# MicroDB
A tiny database implementation starter project using Spring Boot to map http requests to database operations. In its current form this project only supports a single table with two columns (ID and a String) -- This is sufficient for basic implementation exercises but can be augmented fairly easily.

## Caveats

- This project is a sample for use during an educational course. It should not be taken as an example of excellent code or a standalone lesson
- The "Database" for this application is nothing more than an in-memory data structure, with no indexes or robust functionality
- This is by no means enterprise-ready
- Seriously, **don't use this for anything that matters!** it's a toy project to play around with ideas and build conceptual familiarity. You've been warned.
